to use these portals create a new item, choose between:
1. Steel Server Portal - (Steel Portal Model, the one with glowing ball inside)
2. Huge Server Portal - (Epic Portal Model, same as steel, without the glowing ball).
3. Server Portal - (The craftable small epic portal model).
4. The Ring - unknown (#give 297) can be used as a portal. Set data just like the rest, nice gift for players to get them to events fast.
5. Rift Portal - (The hole in the ground with black smoke crystals around it)

Set data1 to the value of the x position you want to transport to.
Set data 2 to the value of the y position you want to transport to.
Set AuxData to 1. (You must set AuxData to 1 or it will not work. I have done this to prepare for future different portal types).
